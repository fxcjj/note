RuntimeException是那些在JVM中正常运行期间抛出的异常的超类。

任何RuntimeException的子类，在执行可能抛出异常（未捕获）的方法期间，无需声明throws子句。

public class RuntimeException extends Exception


/** Constructs a new runtime exception with <code>null</code> as its
 * detail message.  The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be
 * initialized by a call to {@link #initCause}.
 */
public RuntimeException() {
super();
}

/** Constructs a new runtime exception with the specified detail message.
 * The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a
 * call to {@link #initCause}.
 *
 * @param   message   the detail message. The detail message is saved for 
 *          later retrieval by the {@link #getMessage()} method.
 */
public RuntimeException(String message) {
super(message);
}

/**
 * Constructs a new runtime exception with the specified detail message and
 * cause.  <p>Note that the detail message associated with
 * <code>cause</code> is <i>not</i> automatically incorporated in
 * this runtime exception's detail message.
 *
 * @param  message the detail message (which is saved for later retrieval
 *         by the {@link #getMessage()} method).

 *         unknown.)

	super(message, cause);

/** Constructs a new runtime exception with the specified cause and a
