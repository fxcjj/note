1、git pull时报如下错误
error: cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master': Unable to create 'E:/note/.git/refs/remotes/origin/master.lock': File exists.
If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.

解决方法
删除E:/note/.git/refs/remotes/origin/master.lock这个文件
