# 这是一个系统级配置文件，用于跟踪各种容器后端注册表
# This is a system-wide configuration file used to keep track of registries for various container backends.

# 它遵循TOML格式，不支持注册中心的递归列表。
# It adheres to TOML format and does not support recursive lists of registries.

# The default location for this configuration file is /etc/containers/registries.conf.

# The only valid categories are: 'registries.search', 'registries.insecure', and 'registries.block'.

[registries.search]
registries = ['registry.access.redhat.com', 'docker.io', 'registry.fedoraproject.org', 'quay.io', 'registry.centos.org']

# If you need to access insecure registries, add the registry's fully-qualified name.
# An insecure registry is one that does not have a valid SSL certificate or only does HTTP.
[registries.insecure]
registries = ['']


# If you need to block pull access from a registry, uncomment the section below
# and add the registries fully-qualified name.
#
# Docker only
[registries.block]
registries = []
