Zookeeper: A distributed coordination service for distributed applications

Design Goals
	simple
	replicated
	ordered
	fast
	
Data model and the hierarchical namespace
	The name space provided by ZooKeeper is much like that of a stardand file system.

Nodes and ephemeral nodes
	node
	ephemeral node
	
Conditional updates and watches
		ZooKeeper supports the concept of watches. 
		Clients can set a watch on a znodes. A watch will be triggered and removed 
		when the znode changes. When a watch is triggered the client receives a packet
		saying that the znode has changed. And if the connection between the client 
		and one of the Zoo Keeper servers is broken, the client will receive a local
		notification. These can be used to [tbd].

Guarantees
	Sequential Consistency
	Atomicity
	Single System Image
	Reliability
	Timeliness
	
Simple API
	create
	delete
	exists
	get data
	set data
	get children
	sync
